// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Where one person's data lives, for subject access and erasure requests.
//
// This system stores occupational-health data — injuries, illnesses, medical
// restrictions, GP letters. Under GDPR and India's DPDP Act that is sensitive
// personal data, and a person may ask to see all of it, or to have it deleted.
// Neither question can be answered without first knowing every place their data
// is, and that is what this file is.
//
// ── The one thing to understand before using any of it ──────────────────────
//
// A person appears in this database in TWO fundamentally different ways, and
// only one of them can be found by a query:
//
//   JOINED     A structural key names them: `personId` on an injury,
//              `employeeUid` on a training record, `actorUid` in the audit log,
//              the uid in their own /users profile. These are indexed,
//              queryable, exact, and complete. Every one of them is found.
//
//   MENTIONED  Their NAME appears as free text inside an object in an array —
//              `affectedPersonnel[].name` on an incident, `attendees[].name` in
//              committee minutes, `commanders[]` on a drill, `capa[].owner` on
//              an action. Firestore cannot query inside array objects for a
//              substring, so these cannot be found by any query. They can only
//              be found by reading every document in the collection and looking.
//
// Pretending the second kind does not exist would produce an export that looks
// authoritative and is incomplete, which is worse than one that says where it
// stopped. So the planner reports both, separately and by name, and the caller
// decides how much work to do.
//
// ── And the interaction that will break this later ──────────────────────────
//
// Application-layer encryption (src/shared/crypto/policy.js) seals exactly the
// MENTIONED fields — names are personal data, so of course it does. Join keys
// are deliberately left readable so queries keep working, which is why the
// JOINED half is unaffected. But once `VITE_ENCRYPTION=on` and the backfill has
// run, a server-side scan for a name finds ciphertext, and the medical private
// key is manager-only by design. The scan then has to happen in the browser of
// somebody entitled to decrypt, or not at all.
//
// Encryption is currently off in production (SECURITY.md S-07), so a scan works
// today. It will stop working the day that changes, silently, returning zero
// matches rather than an error. `scanFeasibility()` below exists to say so out
// loud rather than let an empty result read as "this person is not mentioned".
//
// Pure. No Firestore, no Admin SDK — index.js executes what this decides, which
// is what makes the decisions testable and keeps the legal reasoning readable.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
