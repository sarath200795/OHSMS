// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Sealing what is already stored.
//
// Turning VITE_ENCRYPTION on seals new writes and nothing else. Every incident,
// injury, illness, meeting and drill filed before that moment stays in plaintext
// in the database — and what is already stored IS the exposure. That is the
// same sentence written at the top of incidentMedical.js, medicalRecords.js and
// the visibility backfill, for the same reason each time: closing the write path
// closes nothing already written.
//
// ── Why this runs in the browser and not in functions/ ───────────────────────
//
// Every other migration in this project is a Cloud Function, and this one
// deliberately is not.
//
// functions/ deploys as its own package and cannot import from src/, so a
// server-side version would need its own copy of the policy table AND its own
// copy of the path walker. The AAD bound into every sealed value IS the policy
// path string — `capa[].owner`, not `capa[0].owner` — so the two copies would
// have to agree character for character, forever. They would not: MEDICAL_FIELDS
// and REGION are already duplicated across that seam with a comment begging
// whoever edits one to edit the other.
//
// The failure mode if they ever drifted is the worst one available. A value
// sealed under `capa[].owner` and read under `capa[].ownerName` does not throw
// at write time, does not throw at read time, and cannot be recovered: it fails
// its authentication tag forever, and the plaintext it replaced is gone. A
// silent, permanent, irreversible loss of occupational health records, caused by
// a typo in a duplicated string.
//
// So this uses the app's own sealDoc, against the app's own policy, through the
// app's own key material. There is exactly one implementation, and the migration
// cannot seal anything differently from the way a normal save would.
//
// What that costs is the Admin SDK: this runs as a signed-in administrator and
// is bound by firestore.rules like any other client code. That is acceptable
// here — an admin can already read and write every collection in this table —
// and it buys something a Cloud Function could not have: the person running the
// migration holds BOTH key classes, so every document can be opened again and
// checked before its plaintext is overwritten.
//
// ── The safety property ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing is written until the sealed copy has been decrypted back and compared,
// field by field, against the plaintext it would replace. The check is local and
// costs no round trip, and it happens BEFORE the destructive write rather than
// after — which is the one ordering difference from confineMedicalRecords, and
// it is forced by the shape of the job. That migration COPIED, so it could write
// first and verify before deleting the original. This one OVERWRITES: there is
// no moment after the write where the plaintext still exists to be compared
// against. Verify first, or do not verify at all.
//
// A document that fails the check is left exactly as it was and reported.
//
// ── Idempotent, resumable, and safe to run with the switch off ───────────────
//
// sealValue passes an already-sealed value through untouched, so a re-run costs
// reads and writes nothing. A run interrupted half way leaves every document
// either fully sealed or fully plaintext — never half of one — because each
// document is one write.
//
// It does need VITE_ENCRYPTION=on, because sealDoc is a no-op without it. A run
// attempted with sealing off would report every document as "nothing to do" and
// look like a success, which is why that is checked first and refused loudly.
