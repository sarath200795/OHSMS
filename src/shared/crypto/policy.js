// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHICH fields are encrypted, and under which of the two keys.
//
// One table, read by the client on every write and every read, and by the
// backfill in functions/ when it encrypts what is already stored. It is the only
// place any of that is decided; a field that is not named here is stored in the
// clear, and that has to be a decision somebody made rather than a file somebody
// forgot to edit.
//
// ── The two key classes, and why they are the two ────────────────────────────
//
// They are not a severity scale. Each one is a copy of a boundary firestore.rules
// already enforces, because a key class that does not line up with a rule either
// locks people out of data they are entitled to or hands it to people the rules
// refuse — and in both cases the rule and the key would have to be reasoned
// about separately forever after.
//
//   general   Readable and writable by every approved member, auditor included.
//             Symmetric: one org data key, held by anyone who can read the
//             collection anyway. It buys nothing against a member, and it is not
//             meant to — it is what stands between this data and everything that
//             reaches the STORE rather than the app: an exported backup, a
//             misconfigured bucket, a support engineer with project Viewer, and
//             the next rule that turns out to be one `match` too wide.
//
//   medical   `allow read: if isManagerOf(orgId)` — /injuries, its /records
//             subcollection, and /illnesses (firestore.rules). Members WRITE
//             these and cannot read them back, so this class is hybrid: the
//             public half goes to writers, the private half only to admin and
//             manager. See the header of envelope.js for why a symmetric key
//             cannot express that and would quietly undo the control.
//
// The auditor is the case worth stating plainly, because it is the finding this
// whole exercise came out of. An auditor is an outside party with a login. They
// get the general key, because inspecting the safety record is their job. They
// are refused the medical private key by the same test that refuses them the
// documents — so if the injuries rule is ever widened by accident, they get
// ciphertext instead of a colleague's medication.
//
// ── Path syntax ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//     field                a top-level field
//     parent.child         a nested object
//     list[].child         `child` on every element of the `list` array
//     list[]               every element of `list`, when they are scalars
//
// The path as WRITTEN here is what gets bound into the ciphertext — never the
// concrete index. `capa[].owner` is the binding for every element, so reordering
// the array, inserting at the front, or deleting an entry leaves the rest
// readable. Binding `capa[3].owner` would make a drag-to-reorder into silent
// data loss.
//
// ── What is deliberately NOT encrypted ───────────────────────────────────────
//
//   · Anything a query filters or orders on. Every `where` in this app is on a
//     structural key (orgId, incidentId, personId, sessionId, permitId,
//     employeeUid, deletedAt) and every `orderBy` is on a timestamp — which is
//     the reason this change needs no query rewrites at all. Encrypting one of
//     them would mean a client-side scan of the whole collection instead.
//   · Anything firestore.rules reads. `myProfile()` tests orgId, status, role
//     and mustChangePassword on /users; rules cannot decrypt, so a sealed value
//     there would raise, and a rule that raises denies — locking every member
//     out of the app at once.
//   · The /users directory itself. Names ARE personal data and this leaves them
//     in the clear, which is a real limitation and not an oversight: the name of
//     a person is denormalised onto dozens of records (`createdByName`,
//     `personName`, `loggedBy`, `owner`, `attendees[].name`), and sealing the
//     directory while fifty copies stay readable is precisely the mistake the
//     injury/incident split was made to correct — confining one copy and
//     calling it confined. The copies are what this table seals. Sealing the
//     directory as well is a separate change that has to take email, sign-in
//     and provisioning with it.
//   · Reference numbers, ids, dates, sites, regions, entities, lifecycle and
//     status. Operational context that every list, filter and roll-up groups by,
//     and none of it is special-category data on its own.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * `organizations/{orgId}/injuries/{injuryId}/records/{recordId}`.
 *
 * ── `files: true` seals the BYTES, not just the pointer ─────────────────────
 *
 * Sealing a FIELD is invisible to the renderers, because openDoc hands them the
 * plaintext back. Sealing the bytes in the bucket is not: something has to fetch
 * the object through getBlob, decrypt it, and build a URL from the plaintext.
 *
 * Every gallery in this app reads one field — `.dataUrl` — because the data
 * layer normalises `data.dataUrl || data.url` before anything sees it. That
 * contract is why the incident gallery, the drill recorder, the detail modals
 * and all three printed PDF documents need no knowledge of where bytes live,
 * and it is exactly what an encrypted object breaks: `.url` points at
 * ciphertext, and an <img> given that URL renders a broken image.
 *
 * Rather than move a dozen renderers — including the three PDF paths, which are
 * the outputs people rely on for compliance and the hardest thing here to test —
 * the decryption happens at the SEAM, in shared/storage/resolveFiles.js. The
 * pointer list goes in and a list with usable `.dataUrl` values comes out, so
 * not one renderer changed.
 *
 * Turning this on is safe for history. An unsealed object has no encryption
 * metadata, so isSealedFile is false, nothing is fetched, and it keeps the
 * `.url` it always had. Only new uploads take the new path — which means the
 * flag can be set before the objects already in the bucket are re-encrypted.
 *
 * What each `files: true` costs is a blob: URL per sealed object, and a blob URL
 * pins its bytes until revoked. resolveFiles hands back a `revoke` and the
 * callers have somewhere natural to put it: a subscription already returns an
 * unsubscribe, so the previous batch is released when a new snapshot arrives and
 * the last when the listener stops.
