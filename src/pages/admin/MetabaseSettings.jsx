          Column names are matched case-insensitively and ignore spaces and underscores, so
          <code> Site Name</code>, <code>site_name</code> and <code>SITENAME</code> are the same column.
          Anything ODIN does not recognise is listed on the ODIN tab rather than dropped silently.

          <b>Pass</b> and <b>Pass %</b> are different columns. A bare <code>pass</code> beside a bare
          <code> fail</code> is read as a COUNT of checks; <code>pass %</code> is read as a percentage.
          Give ODIN the counts where you have them — they carry how big each audit was, which is what
          lets a region be weighted properly instead of averaging a four-point audit against a
          four-hundred-point one.

          Each question is run with your API key&apos;s permissions, so it must be readable by the group
          that key belongs to. ODIN reads at most 20,000 rows per question and says so on the dashboard
          when a question returns more — group or filter in Metabase to stay under it.
