// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Per-organization module entitlements.
//
// The registry says which modules the product HAS. This says which of them a
// given organization may see and use. One document per org, at
// /moduleEntitlements/{orgId}, written only by the platform operator (see the
// matching block in firestore.rules) and read by every approved member so the
// shell knows which tiles to draw and which routes to refuse.
//
// ABSENT MEANS ENABLED, in two places and for two different reasons:
//
//   • No document at all → the full product. Every organization was in exactly
//     this state before entitlements existed, so introducing them took nothing
//     away from anyone.
//   • Document present but a key missing → that module is on. A module added to
//     the registry after an operator last saved an org would otherwise be
//     withheld from every existing tenant until someone re-saved each one, and
//     a shipped feature that nobody can see is the worse failure.
//
// Only an explicit `false` turns a module off. `normalizeEntitlement` is what
// makes that true everywhere rather than at each call site.
