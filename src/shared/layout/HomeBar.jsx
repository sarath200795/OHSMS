/**
 * Where you are, and the two ways out.
 *
 * The header carries a logo that goes to the portal, but a logo is not a
 * signpost — people do not read it as "home", and on a sub-page three levels
 * into a module there was no way back to the module's own front page at all
 * except the browser button.
 *
 * So: always an app Home, plus the module's own home whenever you are past it.
 * Rendered once here rather than added to forty pages, which also means it
 * cannot drift out of step between modules.
 *
 * Hidden on the portal itself and on the loading screens — offering "Home" to
 * someone already standing on it is noise.
 *
 * It reads as a bar rather than a line of small print because it stopped being
 * legible otherwise: the trail was 12px semibold in ink-500, which landed
 * below AA against the old page canvas. Raising it onto a white surface buys
 * the contrast (ink-800 on surface is well past 4.5:1) and, more usefully,
 * gives the thing an edge — navigation that is flush with the page reads as a
 * caption for the page rather than a control. The brand mark anchors the Home
 * end so the way out is findable by shape before it is read.
