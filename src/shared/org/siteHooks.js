// Things that should happen when a site is created.
//
// Several modules want to react to a new site — CCTV needs its standard Meraki,
// and others will follow. The obvious implementation is for createSite() to call
// them directly, but that would make this shared module import feature modules,
// so the org registry could no longer be read or tested without dragging half
// the app in behind it. The dependency has to point the other way: modules
// register here, and this file knows nothing about any of them.
//
// The rule that matters: A HOOK MUST NEVER FAIL THE SITE CREATION. Adding the
// site is the thing the user asked for and it has already been written by the
// time hooks run. A CCTV record that failed to appear is recoverable — the
// inventory offers a backfill for exactly that — whereas an error thrown here
// would surface as "could not create site" for a site that now exists, and the
// retry would create it twice.
