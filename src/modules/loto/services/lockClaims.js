// One document per padlock currently applied, so the same lock cannot be put on
// two machines at once.
//
// THE DOCUMENT ID IS THE PADLOCK — `${orgId}__${lockNo}`. That is what makes the
// uniqueness real rather than advisory: two operators claiming lock 12 are two
// writes to ONE document, and Firestore serialises those. Neither of the checks
// this backs up could do that, and the gap between them is where the failure
// lived:
//
//   · setPointLock validated the number inside the single procedure document it
//     had already read, so it could see the other points on THIS equipment and
//     nothing about the machine in the next bay;
//   · the operate screen filtered the numbers it offered against
//     collectInUseLockNos(procedures) — a browser-side scan of a list that is
//     itself truncated at COLLECTION_READ_CAP, so a lock held by a procedure
//     past the cap was absent from the in-use set and therefore offered as
//     free.
//
// So two operators both saw #12 available and both committed. In lockout/tagout
// that is not a duplicate reference number: it is a machine one person believes
// their own lock is holding dead while the lock physically on it is somebody
// else's, and the whole control depends on that not being possible.
//
// Claims are taken and released in the SAME transaction as the lock state they
// describe, for the reason the public mirror is: a claim written separately can
// be stranded by a failure between the two writes, and a padlock the system
// insists is in use but nobody can find is how people learn to work around the
// system.
//
// The rules block for this collection (`firestore.rules`, /lockClaims) is the
// other half. `resource == null` on create is the guarantee — without it a
// second claimant's create succeeds by overwriting the first — and the id
// prefix is pinned to the payload's org so a stranger cannot take out a claim
// at another tenant's address and make a padlock permanently unusable there.
