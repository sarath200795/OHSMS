// Evidence attached to an escalation: CCTV footage, and an ethics report.
//
// CCTV is the awkward one. A useful clip is video, and the app's upload ceiling
// is 10 MB — most exports blow through that before the first minute. Refusing
// them would mean the footage that settles a dispute is the one thing not on
// the record, so an attachment here can be EITHER an uploaded file OR a
// reference: where the footage lives, which camera, and when.
//
// The reference is not a lesser option. Naming the camera and the timestamp
// means the clip can still be pulled off the DVR months later, whereas a link
// to someone's drive rots the day they leave. Both are kept.
