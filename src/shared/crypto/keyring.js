// The keys this tab holds, and what happens when it holds none.
//
// One fetch per session, from the getDataKeys callable, cached in a module
// variable for the life of the tab. Never localStorage, never IndexedDB, never
// a cookie: a key in site storage outlives the tab, the sign-out and the browser
// restart, which would quietly undo the session-scoped auth persistence this app
// chose on purpose (browserSessionPersistence in shared/firebase.js) — the
// session would end and the means to read every sealed field would still be
// sitting on the disk of a shared site laptop.
//
// The imported CryptoKeys are non-extractable, so the realistic browser-side
// theft — a script that finds this module's cache and posts what it holds — gets
// handles it cannot serialise rather than the keys themselves.
//
// ── The switch, and why it governs writes only ───────────────────────────────
//
// VITE_ENCRYPTION turns SEALING on. Opening is always attempted, whatever the
// switch says, and that asymmetry is the whole rollout story:
//
//   · off → new writes are plaintext, old sealed values still decrypt. This is
//     the DEFAULT, so this code can be merged and deployed before the master
//     secret exists or the callable is live, and nothing changes for anybody.
//   · on  → new writes are sealed, everything decrypts.
//   · on, then off again → still readable. Turning it off is a valid rollback
//     and does not strand a single record, which is the property that makes
//     turning it on a decision somebody can reverse at 3am.
//
// A switch that gated reads as well would make its own rollback destructive, and
// that is exactly the sort of switch nobody dares touch.
//
// ── What happens with no keys ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Writing REFUSES. It does not fall back to plaintext, because a fallback that
// writes the cleartext of a medication into a field the policy says is sealed is
// the silent failure this whole exercise exists to prevent — and it would look
// exactly like success. The refusal names the field class and tells the person
// to reload, which is recoverable; a plaintext write is not.
//
// Reading DEGRADES. A value this reader has no key for is dropped from the
// document (policy.js OMIT), so an auditor opening an injury record sees it with
// the clinical columns absent rather than an error page. That is the normal,
// designed outcome for a role that is meant to be refused, and it must not be
// reported as a fault.
//
// The offline case falls out of the caching. Keys are fetched at sign-in, while
// the session is by definition online; a tab that then goes into a dead spot on
// site WiFi keeps sealing from memory and Firestore keeps queuing the writes.
// Only a session that STARTS offline has no keys, and such a session cannot
// reach Firestore either.
