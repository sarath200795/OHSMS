// The two functions the rest of the app calls.
//
//     sealDoc(orgId, collection, data)   before every write
//     openDoc(orgId, collection, data)   after every read
//
// Everything below them — which fields, which key, which scheme, what happens
// when a key is missing — is decided in policy.js, keyring.js and envelope.js.
// A module calls these two and does not otherwise know that encryption exists,
// which is deliberate: the alternative is an `if (encrypted)` in forty
// renderers, thirty-nine of which stay correct.
//
// ── Both are safe on data that is not sealed ─────────────────────────────────
//
// openDoc passes any value that is not a well-formed envelope straight through,
// and sealDoc passes any value that already IS one straight through. Together
// those two make every ordering work: sealed data read by an old build, plain
// data read by a new one, a half-migrated collection, a document that was
// written while the switch was off and updated after it was turned on. There is
// no flag day and no moment where a record is unreadable because the code and
// the data disagree about an era.
//
// ── What openDoc does with a value it cannot open ────────────────────────────
//
// It removes the field and records the path in `_restricted`. It does NOT
// throw, and it does not leave the ciphertext in place. This is the auditor
// opening an injury record, and it is a normal, designed page view rather than
// an error: they see the record with the clinical columns absent, and every
// `(injury.bodyParts || []).map(...)` in the renderers keeps working without one
// of them being edited. See OMIT in policy.js.
//
// `_restricted` is there so a screen can say "restricted" rather than silently
// showing a record that looks complete and is not. A safety system that displays
// a partial record as if it were whole is worse than one that refuses to display
// it.
