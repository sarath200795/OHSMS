 * sanitises every path segment (a slash becomes an underscore) and storage.rules
 * matches exactly orgs/{orgId}/{kind}/{fileName}, so a nested path would be
 * silently flattened by one and refused by the other — and encoding a whole
 * region/entity/site/bucket chain into the single `kind` segment would produce a
 * key that changes the moment anybody renames a site. The tree lives in
 * Firestore, where it can be reorganised freely; the bytes stay where they were
 * put, and the document record is what connects the two.
 *
 * The region is sanitised HERE, by the same rule storagePath() applies, so the
 * folder recorded on the document is byte-identical to the path the file went
 * to. A region name that survives none of it — nothing in A-Za-z0-9 at all —
 * would make storagePath throw, so those share one region folder rather than
 * failing the upload outright.
