 * Nothing implemented it: soft-deleted records sat in the database for as long
 * as the project existed, including illness records carrying health data,
 * unless a human remembered to click Purge. The countdown ran down to zero and
 * then kept going.
 *
 * A stated retention period that nothing enforces is worse than none at all —
 * it is a control an auditor will test, a claim a data subject can rely on, and
 * the reason someone stops worrying about the delete they performed.
 *
 * Pure planning only. Nothing here reads or writes Firestore; index.js does
 * that with what these functions decide, which is what makes the decisions
 * testable without a database and the destructive half small enough to read.

 * and it meant the most dangerous code in the system — unattended, irreversible
 * deletion of occupational-health records — reported success no matter what
 * happened inside it. `retryCount` is 0 and nothing ever threw, so a sweep that
 * had been failing for months looked exactly like one with nothing to do, while
 * the app went on telling users their data is purged after 30 days.
 *
 * So: do all the work, then fail. The resilience is unchanged; only the
 * reporting is. A thrown error at the end marks the invocation FAILED, which is
 * the signal Cloud Monitoring alerts on without any extra instrumentation
 * (PRODUCTION.md 2a).
 *
 * Pure so the "when do we shout" decision is testable without a database —
 * which is the same reason planPurge lives here rather than in index.js.
