// May this caller delete this file?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Cloud Storage rules read the caller's org and role off the
// presented ID TOKEN, because a Storage rule cannot query Firestore. A token is
// valid until it expires — up to an hour — so a manager suspended, demoted or
// moved to another tenant kept the ability to delete any file in their old
// organization for the rest of that hour. Stripping the claim does not reach
// back into a token already issued, and revoking refresh tokens does not
// either: rules never consult tokensValidAfterTime. That is SECURITY.md S-19.
//
// Deleting is the operation where that matters. It is irreversible, the files
// ARE the evidence — incident photos, permit documents, isolation procedure
// photos, drill evidence — and it leaves nothing in the audit trail, which only
// records what the app chose to write.
//
// The obvious fix, a cross-service firestore.get() inside storage.rules, was
// written and reverted: the Storage emulator does not evaluate cross-service
// calls, so the rule could not be tested at all, in the one file that is the
// only enforcement boundary this app has. Every refusal test passed while the
// feature was broken, because everything was refusing.
//
// So the check moved here, where the profile is read LIVE on every call and the
// decision runs under a test suite. storage.rules now refuses client deletes
// outright; this is the only way a signed-in user can remove a file.
//
// Pure, so every branch is exercised without the Admin SDK — which is the part
// that cannot run in a unit test.
