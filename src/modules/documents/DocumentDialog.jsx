/**
 * Adding a document, or editing one.
 *
 * A document is A FILE OR A LINK, and the two are the same kind of thing here:
 * both are something you open, both live in a folder, both show up in the
 * browser as a file. The only place the difference surfaces is this form, where
 * one asks for bytes and the other for an address.
 *
 * WHERE it goes is a first-class field rather than something implied by which
 * folder you happened to be standing in. That single control is also the move:
 * changing it on an existing document re-files it, which is why there is no
 * separate "Move to…" anywhere else in the module.
 *
 * There is no site or region picker. The folder IS the classification — filing
 * into a site's Pre Launch folder is what makes the document that site's, in
 * the tree and in firestore.rules at once. A second control could only disagree
 * with the first.

   * document belongs, and the nearest default — Org Level — is the WIDEST
   * visibility there is. Guessing that direction publishes things.
