// One stored file, resolved into something an <img src> can use.
//
// `resolveFiles.js` does this for LISTS, at the data seam, so that galleries and
// the printed PDFs needed no changes. This is the other shape: a single pointer
// rendered directly by a component — a course thumbnail, an organisation logo,
// an inspection's photo evidence, a LOTO isolation point.
//
// ── Why those sites had to change at all ────────────────────────────────────
//
// They rendered `<img src={record.url}>`, and `record.url` was a Firebase
// download URL: a permanent bearer credential in a string, which works for
// anyone holding it, signed in or not, forever, with no rule ever consulted.
// The read path for sealed files moved off those long ago; the WRITE path went
// on manufacturing one for every upload and filing it in a document readable by
// every member of the tenant and by the external auditor (audit finding M-5,
// A.8.3 / A.5.14).
//
// `adapters/firebase.js` no longer mints one. That closes the creation of new
// credentials and breaks exactly these renderers, because the field they read
// is now empty — hence this hook, which asks `fileUrl()` for an authenticated
// fetch by `path` instead.
//
// ── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not stop working for records written before this change. `fileUrl`
// falls back to the stored url when there is no path, or when the fetch fails
// (a bucket with no CORS rule for this origin, an object that has gone). Old
// records keep rendering exactly as they did; only new ones take the new route.
// Revoking the tokens already written down is a separate, deliberate operation
// — see `revokeDownloadTokens` in functions/index.js, which is why it defaults
// to reporting rather than revoking.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
