// Turning a list of stored file pointers into URLs a renderer can use.
//
// Every gallery in this app reads one field — `.dataUrl` — whichever era the
// file was saved in, because the data layer normalises `data.dataUrl ||
// data.url` before anything sees it. That contract is why the incident gallery,
// the drill recorder, the detail modals and all three printed PDF documents
// need no knowledge of where bytes actually live.
//
// An ENCRYPTED object breaks that contract and cannot be made to fit it: the
// bytes behind `.url` are ciphertext, and a browser handed that URL renders a
// broken image. The fix could have been to move every renderer onto a hook —
// and that was the plan recorded in policy.js — but it would have meant editing
// a dozen `<img>` tags and, worse, the three PDF paths, which are the outputs
// people rely on for compliance and the hardest thing here to test.
//
// This does it at the seam instead. The pointer list goes in, a list with usable
// `.dataUrl` values comes out, and not one renderer changes.
//
// ── The revocation, which is the whole reason this is a module ───────────────
//
// A decrypted object becomes a blob: URL, and a blob: URL pins its bytes in
// memory until it is revoked. A gallery that forgets leaks every photo the user
// scrolls past — the exact failure fileUrl's `revoke` contract exists to
// prevent, now multiplied across a list.
//
// So this returns a `revoke` alongside the rows, and the callers have somewhere
// natural to put it: a subscription already hands back an unsubscribe, so the
// previous batch is revoked when a new snapshot arrives and the last batch when
// the listener stops. Nothing is left to a component remembering.
//
// Unsealed files cost nothing here: they keep the `.url` they always had, no
// fetch happens, and `revoke` has nothing to release for them. That is what
// makes turning `files: true` on safe for history — a bucket full of
// unencrypted objects keeps rendering exactly as before, and only new uploads
// take the new path.
