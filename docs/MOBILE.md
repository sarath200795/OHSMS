# Mobile app

The phone app is this repository. There is no second codebase. A browser can
install the hosted site, and the Android and iOS projects wrap the same
`npm run build` output.

Nothing in the native projects is a secret. Release keystores, provisioning
profiles and App Check debug tokens stay off git. `.gitignore` refuses the
usual filenames; it cannot refuse one that was renamed.

## Two ways it runs

**Installed site (PWA).** Chrome and Safari offer "Add to Home Screen" once
hosting is serving `manifest.webmanifest`. The installed icon opens `/field`.
A device that has chosen the desktop portal is sent on to `/portal`;
otherwise this is the phone home. That home is two labelled groups: Technical
(the field registers) and Admin (settings, employees, maintenance, the audit log).
Admin is omitted when this role cannot open any of those. The service
worker caches the app shell — HTML, the hashed
scripts and styles, the icons — so a page that has loaded once can paint in a
dead spot. It does not cache Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage or App Check.
Those requests leave this origin, and the worker's decision function
(`shellCacheDecision` in `src/shared/mobile/shellCache.js`) passes them
through. Firebase's own offline cache stays off unless `VITE_OFFLINE_CACHE`
is set, which this change does not set.

The worker is registered in a production **browser** only. It is not
registered inside the Capacitor shell. The shell's origin is
`https://localhost` and does not change when the store ships a new binary, so
a worker there would keep serving the previous shell after an update. The
hosted worker is `/sw.js`, at the root because a worker's scope is the
directory it is served from — a file under `/assets/` would not control the
app. Hosting's year-long cache on `*.js` does not apply to it: `firebase.json`
sets `/sw.js` to `no-cache`, after that rule, so a deploy can replace the
worker. The HTML that registers it is also `no-cache`.

**Store apps.** `capacitor.config.json` sets `appId` to `org.weehs.ohsms`,
`appName` to `WEEHS OHSMS`, and `webDir` to `dist`. Android's WebView origin
is `https://localhost` (`androidScheme` + `hostname`). iOS stays on
`capacitor://localhost`. Capacitor will not serve the iOS shell over `https`;
setting `iosScheme` to `https` is rejected by the tool.

`server.url` is absent on purpose. That key points the WebView at a live
host for reload-while-developing. A store build that used it would ship an
empty shell that only works when that host is up, and would skip the review
binary entirely. Do not add it for a release.

## What a hosting deploy has to include

The phone site does not exist until hosting serves this build. The files that
matter, beyond the usual `dist/`:

- `manifest.webmanifest` and `public/icons/` (copied into `dist` by Vite).
- `/sw.js`, the shell worker built from `src/shared/mobile/sw.js`.
- The `firebase.json` header changes in this change:
  - `Permissions-Policy` is `camera=(self)`. It was `camera=()`, which
    forbids `getUserMedia` for every origin including our own, so the PWA
    scanner could not open a camera no matter what the page asked for.
    Microphone stays off.
  - `/manifest.webmanifest` is served as `application/manifest+json` and is
    not given the year-long immutable cache. A stale manifest is how an
    installed icon keeps the old start URL.
  - `/sw.js` is `no-cache`. It is a `.js` file, so without this later rule
    the immutable `*.js` header would pin the worker for a year and a
    deploy would not replace the shell.
- `public/badges/` and `public/store.json`. The login page shows the
  official Play and App Store badges only when those URLs are set.
  `store.json` is `no-cache`, and the shell worker does not cache it.
- `public/downloads/weehs-ohsms.apk` and `weehs-ohsms.json`. The APK is not
  in git. Hosting serves it as `application/vnd.android.package-archive`
  with `no-cache`, and the shell worker does not cache `/downloads/`. The
  badges are hidden inside the Capacitor shell.

Deploy hosting from a checkout of this commit after `npm run build`, and
deploy the Firestore rules in the same release. The rules gained
`organizations/{orgId}/alertReads/{uid}` — the phone's per-user "already
opened" cursor. Without that deploy, marking an alert read is refused and
every row stays unread. Functions are unchanged. Until hosting lands,
suite.weehs.org is still the previous site: no manifest, no scanner, and
the camera policy still blocks the page.

The boot splash is in `index.html`, so the same hosting deploy is what a
phone browser and an installed PWA show on start. The Capacitor splash is
not part of hosting. It ships inside the store binary (`@capacitor/splash-screen`,
`launchAutoHide: false`, background `#f6e3bb`, the existing `splash` drawable).
A binary built before this commit still shows the old launch screen and
never calls `SplashScreen.hide()`.

## Splash

A phone (under 768px) and the native shells paint a cream screen and the
mark before the bundle. The mark scales in once. `prefers-reduced-motion`
drops that scale. A desktop browser does not see it: the splash is
`display: none` from the first style block, and the bundle removes the node.

The native splash stays up until the page calls `SplashScreen.hide()` with
a short fade. It uses the same cream, so the fade reveals the HTML splash
rather than a white WebView, and the HTML splash then fades into the app.
`launchAutoHide` is false on purpose. The plugin's own timer hides on a
clock, which is how the native screen disappears before the HTML has
painted and the handoff flashes white. The cost is the one named above: if
the bundle never runs, the native splash has nothing to dismiss it. The
HTML splash removes itself after eight seconds so a failed script is not a
permanent cream screen. A stored desktop choice hides the splash on a phone
the same way a wide browser does (`html.desktop-view`).

## View mode

The phone home and the desktop portal are two modes. The first visit picks
one and stores nothing: the native app is the phone home; a viewport of
1024px or wider is the desktop portal, including a large tablet; a phone
user agent, a coarse pointer under that width, or a window under 768px is
the phone home. A laptop window between 768 and 1023 stays the desktop
portal, which is what that width already was.

Both homes show a switch, "Switch to desktop view" or "Switch to mobile
view". The choice is stored on this device (`ohsms.viewMode` in
localStorage), so the phone and the office PC can differ. "Use automatic"
clears it and the next paint follows the device again. Desktop view on a
phone is the existing portal, scrolled, without the field bar. Mobile view
on a desktop is the phone home, centred, with the field bar centred under it.

## Alerts

The Alerts tab reads collections the product already has: defect reports,
incidents, committee meetings and mock drills, scoped to the sites the
signed-in person can see. Weather is not one of those collections. The
digest is a mail, and the screen reads current conditions the same way the
weather page does. A weather row is a site at Medium or worse, and its id
includes the digest's six-hour slot, so the next window is unread again.

Web push (FCM) is not part of this. Nothing buzzes when the app is closed.
The badge is the unread count while it is open. It pulses. The home icons
keep a small loop after they arrive — a float, a sway, a pulse or a fade,
each on its own beat. The desktop module logos play their own motion the
whole time, shifted so a row is not in step, instead of waiting for a
hover. The entrance, the press, those loops and the badge all stop when
the OS asks for reduced motion. The loops are transform and opacity only.

## Signing in, inside the WebView

Email and password (`signInWithEmailAndPassword`) does not consult the
authorised-domain list. It works in the Android and iOS shells with no
console change.

The browser keeps using session persistence, so a shared workstation signs
out when the window closes. The native shells use local persistence. The
failure that motivated that split: opening the camera or locking the phone
tears the WebView down, session persistence treats that as the window
closing, and the person standing at a cylinder is back on the login screen.
`IdleGuard` still ends a session that sits unused.

Organisation single sign-on is the part that needs a console change, and the
two platforms are not the same.

**Android.** A WebView usually refuses the popup, and the app then falls
back to `signInWithRedirect`. The redirect can return only if the WebView's
origin is an authorised domain. Add `localhost` under Authentication →
Settings → Authorised domains, on the Firebase project this build talks to
(`weehs-4eb28` for the deployment at suite.weehs.org). `localhost` is the
hostname in `capacitor.config.json`. Do not add a port. After that, Google
and Microsoft redirect can finish. Until it is added, use email and password;
the redirect comes back to a domain Firebase rejects.

**iOS.** The origin is `capacitor://localhost`. Authorised domains are web
origins Firebase can put on an `https` allow-list, and this one cannot be
added. A redirect would leave the person on a page the WebView cannot come
back from. The app does not attempt it: when the popup is blocked it throws
`auth/native-sso-unsupported` and the login screen says to use email and
password. That is a platform limit, not a missing toggle.

Password reset keeps using the hosted auth handler. It does not depend on
the WebView's origin.

## App Check

reCAPTCHA v3 tokens are minted for hostnames listed on the site key. The
day the site moved to suite.weehs.org, tokens failed until that host was
added; `https://localhost` and `capacitor://localhost` fail the same way
until they are listed, and the `capacitor://` origin cannot be listed.
Enforcement is off (see the comment in `src/shared/firebase.js`). Leave it
off until you have decided what a native shell should present. Turning it
on first locks the store apps out of Firestore while the website keeps
working, which is a hard outage to diagnose from a field report.

Do not put `VITE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` in a store build. A debug token in
the binary is an attestation bypass for anyone who unpacks the app. A debug
token for a single developer machine belongs in that machine's untracked
env file.

## Scanning a label

Equipment labels encode `<origin>/qr/<token>`. The origin on a sticker
already in the field is either `https://suite.weehs.org` or
`https://weehs-4eb28.web.app`. Permits encode `/permit/<token>`, isolation
procedures `/p/<id>`, tags `/t/<id>/<point>`. `parseQrPayload` /
`routeForScan` (`src/shared/mobile/qrPayload.js`) accept those paths and
nothing else. A code from another system, a `javascript:` URL, or a path
that climbs out of the route is not followed — the scan screen says the
code was not opened. The route it does produce is always an in-app path.
A scan cannot become a navigation to someone else's host.

The signed-in page is `/field/asset/<token>`. It reads the world-readable
`qr/{token}` mirror and then offers only what `can()` already allows on
the registers: inspect and raise for a member, close for a manager, nothing
for an auditor. A mirror whose `orgId` is another organisation, or is
missing, gets an explanation and no write button. The mirror being readable
is not permission to write the asset.

On Android and iOS the camera is `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning`
(`BarcodeScanner.scan`, QR only). On Android that call uses the Google Play
barcode module, which is not on the device until the first install. The
scan screen waits for that download. A phone without Play services cannot
complete it; the paste field still works. iOS uses ML Kit through CocoaPods.
The plugin does not support Swift Package Manager — do not switch the iOS
project to SPM or the scanner pod will not link.

In the browser and the installed PWA the same screen uses `BarcodeDetector`
where the browser has it, and `html5-qrcode` where it does not. Both need
the camera permission and the `camera=(self)` header above.

The native projects carry the platform strings that make those cameras
legal to open:

- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — `CAMERA`, and
  `com.google.mlkit.vision.DEPENDENCIES` = `barcode_ui` inside
  `<application>`. Without the meta-data the module is downloaded on first
  scan instead of with the app, and the first person on a poor connection
  waits in front of the cylinder.
- `ios/App/App/Info.plist` — `NSCameraUsageDescription`.
- `ios/App/Podfile` — `platform :ios, '15.5'`, which is ML Kit's floor.

## Direct install, before the stores

The login page does not show a store badge until that listing URL is set
(`VITE_PLAY_STORE_URL`, `VITE_APP_STORE_URL`, or the same keys in
`public/store.json`). What it shows instead:

- **Download APK** links to `/downloads/weehs-ohsms.apk` on this origin. The
  version next to it is `version` in `public/downloads/weehs-ohsms.json`.
  A phone will ask for permission to install from the browser. That
  permission is per browser, in that browser's app settings. There is no
  separate "unknown sources" switch on current Android.
- **Install on iPhone** opens the Safari steps: Share, Add to Home Screen.
  An iPhone cannot install an `.ipa` from the browser, so the page does not
  offer one. `VITE_TESTFLIGHT_URL` (or `testFlightUrl` in `store.json`) adds
  a TestFlight link when it is `https://testflight.apple.com/...`.
- The whole block is hidden inside the Capacitor shell. Someone who already
  has the app open does not need a second copy.

### Getting the APK onto hosting

The file is produced by the **Android APK** workflow
(`.github/workflows/android-apk.yml`). It runs on a version tag (`v*`) and
from the Actions tab. It does not run on pull requests.

1. Set the same repository variables the hosting build uses (`VITE_FIREBASE_*`
   and the rest named in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). Without them the
   APK still builds, and then cannot sign in.
2. For a signature that survives the next build, create an upload keystore
   **outside this repository** (the command is under Building Android) and
   add four Actions secrets: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (the keystore file,
   base64, no line breaks), `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`,
   `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. All four must be set. If any is missing the
   workflow ships a debug-signed APK instead. A debug-signed APK and a later
   release-signed APK do not install over each other; the phone has to
   uninstall first. A debug keystore created on the runner is also a new key
   every run, so two debug APKs from CI may not install over each other either.
3. Run the workflow. The artifact `weehs-ohsms-apk` holds `weehs-ohsms.apk`
   and `weehs-ohsms.json`. On a tag, those two files are also attached to
   that GitHub release.
4. Hosting only serves what `npm run build` copied out of `public/`. The
   Deploy workflow, on a version tag, downloads the release assets into
   `public/downloads/` before the build. The tag push starts both workflows
   at once, so that download usually misses. Re-run **Deploy** after
   **Android APK** is green. If the asset is not there yet, Deploy still
   ships the site and the button 404s.
5. From a machine, the same placement is:

```bash
mkdir -p public/downloads
cp weehs-ohsms.apk public/downloads/weehs-ohsms.apk
cp weehs-ohsms.json public/downloads/weehs-ohsms.json
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

`public/downloads/*.apk` is gitignored. Do not commit the binary. The JSON
in git is the version the page shows until a deploy replaces it. A Firebase
Storage URL may be put in that JSON's `url` instead of the hosting path;
only `firebasestorage.googleapis.com` and `*.firebasestorage.app` are
accepted, and anything else is ignored in favour of
`/downloads/weehs-ohsms.apk`.

## Building Android

Needs Android Studio (current stable) and JDK 21. Capacitor 8 compiles
against Java 21; a machine whose only JDK is 17 will fail the Gradle build
with a source-release error. Android Studio's bundled JDK is the one to
point `JAVA_HOME` at.

```bash
npm ci
npm run mobile:sync    # production build, then copies dist/ into the native projects
npm run mobile:android # opens Android Studio
```

`mobile:sync` is the step that has to be re-run after every web change. The
native project does not watch `src/`.

**Debug APK**, for a device over USB. In Android Studio: Build → Build
APK(s). The debug keystore is the public Android debug key. It installs on
a device with USB debugging. It is not what Play accepts.

**Release AAB**, for Play. Play requires an Android App Bundle, and Play
App Signing holds the app signing key. You hold a separate upload key.

1. Create the upload keystore **outside this repository**.
   `keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload`
   Store the file and both passwords in the organisation's password
   manager. Losing the upload key is a support ticket with Google, not a
   new keystore.
2. Do not write the keystore path or the passwords into a file that is
   committed. `android/keystore.properties` is gitignored; if you use one,
   keep it on the build machine only. Android Studio's Build → Generate
   Signed Bundle dialog asks for the keystore path at build time and does
   not write it back into the project. Prefer that.
3. Upload the `.aab` to Play Console, internal testing track first.
4. Each upload needs a higher `versionCode` than the last one Play
   accepted. `versionName` is the number people see. Both live in
   `android/app/build.gradle`. Bump them in the same commit as the release
   you intend to ship, not as a drive-by.

Play Console is a separate account from Firebase (a one-time registration
fee; the store publishes the current amount). The listing needs a privacy
policy URL, a data-safety form, and a declaration for the camera
permission. The camera is used to scan equipment QR codes and to attach
photos to inspections, defects and incident reports. Content rating and
target API level are whatever Play currently requires for new apps; the
console blocks a release that is behind, so read that block rather than a
number copied into this file.

A build anyone can install from Play also needs the app to be reviewed.
Internal testing is the track that does not wait on that, and it is the
right first upload.

## Building iOS

The iOS project in this repository was generated without CocoaPods. Pods
are not committed. The archive has to be made on a Mac.

```bash
npm ci
npm run mobile:sync
cd ios/App && pod install && cd ../..
npm run mobile:ios      # opens Xcode
```

`pod install` is required after every `cap sync` that changes plugins. The
workspace to open is `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`, which `pod install` creates.
Opening the `.xcodeproj` instead builds without ML Kit and the scanner does
not link.

Needs Xcode (current stable), CocoaPods, and an Apple Developer Program
membership (an annual fee; Apple publishes the current amount). The bundle
id is `org.weehs.ohsms`.

**Signing.** Xcode → the App target → Signing & Capabilities. Pick the
team. Automatic signing is enough for a device and for TestFlight.
Distribution uses an Apple Distribution certificate and a provisioning
profile; Xcode creates both when the account has the Admin or
App Manager role and automatic signing is on. Do not export a `.p12` into
this repository.

**Archive.** Product → Archive, then Distribute App → App Store Connect.
TestFlight is the first place a build should go. App Store review is a
later promotion of a build you have already installed on a phone.

The version and build numbers are the target's Marketing Version and
Current Project Version in Xcode. The build number has to increase for
every upload, same rule as Android's `versionCode`.

The minimum deployment target is iOS 15.5. Do not lower it to match an
older device: the ML Kit pod will not build.

Email and password sign-in, the PWA, and the Android debug APK do not wait
on the store accounts. The PWA waits on the hosting deploy. The debug APK
waits on a machine with Android Studio.
