// every document has one. So existing records are numbered too, oldest first,
// which is the order they would have been issued in had this always existed.
//
// Two properties matter more than speed here.
//
// It is re-runnable. Records that already have an id are skipped, not
// renumbered, so a run interrupted halfway can simply be run again. An id, once
// issued, is on paper somewhere and cannot change.
//
// It never rewinds a counter. Numbering finishes by raising the live counter to
// the highest it assigned, so ids handed out afterwards continue past the
// backfill rather than colliding with it.
