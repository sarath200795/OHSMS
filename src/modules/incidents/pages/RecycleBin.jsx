 * What each kind of deleted record is called, drawn with, and restored by.
 *
 * A table rather than the `if incident … else …` this used to be. That shape
 * was correct for exactly two kinds and silently wrong for three: adding
 * injuries to the list without touching it would have sent every injury down
 * the illness branch, calling restoreIllness on an id in another collection.
 * The failure would have been a toast saying nothing happened.
