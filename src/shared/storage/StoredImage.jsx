// `useFileUrl` is the hook; this is the shape most call sites actually need,
// because they render inside a `.map()` — an inspection's findings, a LOTO
// procedure's isolation points — and a hook cannot be called in a loop. One
// component per row is how a list of pointers becomes a list of images without
// breaking the rules of hooks.
//
// Why any of this exists: uploads no longer mint a Firebase download URL (audit
// finding M-5, A.8.3 / A.5.14). That string was a permanent bearer credential
// filed in a Firestore document readable by every member of the tenant and by
// the external auditor, and it kept working after they left. The bytes now come
// through an authenticated fetch that `storage.rules` actually governs.
