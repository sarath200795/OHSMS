//
// A first sign-in is admitted only against an invite (stack/identity.mjs), and
// until this file the only invite ever written was the founder's, at
// fulfillment. Everyone else the company's IdP authenticated was told there
// was no account on this organization, so a dedicated environment was a
// one-person environment. The Employees page could not help: it creates WEEHS
// Firebase accounts, which this stack does not have.
//
// Being authenticated by the company's IdP says who someone is. It does not
// say they belong in this tenant, or with what role — an IdP usually holds the
// whole company, contractors included. That decision is an admin's, and this
// is where they make it.
//
// Every call re-reads the caller's live profile. A session token proves who
// signed in, not that they are still an approved admin (the S-19 reasoning in
// storage.rules): an admin demoted a minute ago must not invite anyone.
//
// invites is FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY with no browser grant, so these run as
// the worker role, and the decisions below are the whole of the enforcement.
