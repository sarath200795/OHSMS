/**
 * Give every existing procedure a public mirror.
 *
 * The nine writers above keep the mirror current from now on, and each rebuilds
 * it in full — so any procedure that is locked, approved or revised heals
 * itself. What none of them reaches is a procedure nobody touches: an approved
 * isolation on a machine that is simply working. Its printed code would resolve
 * to "does not match a current procedure", which is the wrong answer and, on a
 * LOTO code, an alarming one.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction — it rewrites from the procedure rather than
 * patching — so running it twice costs writes and changes nothing. `dryRun`
 * reports without writing, because the honest thing before a bulk write is to
 * say how many documents it will touch.
 *
 * Mirrors are checked one at a time rather than queried: `allow list: if false`
 * on /procedureQr means even an approved member cannot page it, which is the
 * property that stops a stranger walking off with every tenant's procedures.
