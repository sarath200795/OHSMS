 * whose audit question was configured under `findings` — with the audits slot
 * pointing at a card id that did not exist — the N+7 tab drew 832 audits from
 * the fallback while Auditors showed "Metabase has no saved question with that
 * ID". One number on one screen and an error on the next, from one dataset.
 *
 * So the decision lives here and both callers ask it. `source` is returned
 * because the two are subtly different populations — one row per audit against
 * one row per checklist line — and a reader comparing months has to know if the
 * basis moved under them.

 * that does not match is dropped, not shown under a guessed name.
 *
 * Pass `findingRows` as null when the findings question did not answer. An

 * as a real month, and the phone must not present one as the last audit.
 * Several scored rows on that date (checklist lines, or two audits the same
 * day with no time) share one score: the mean of each reading, rounded the
 * way the dashboard rounds an aggregate.
 *
 * Open points are tickets still Open, On Hold or In Progress. A ticket that
 * shares the audit's date is that audit's ticket. The ticket question has no
 * audit id, and its date is when the ticket was raised, which is often not
 * the audit's start date — requiring the dates to match is how every centre
 * answered "Open points: none". When nothing shares the date, the open
