# Working in this repository

Conventions that are load-bearing and not obvious from the file you happen to
open. Most of them exist because breaking them once caused a real defect; where
that is the case, the defect is named so the rule is arguable rather than
arbitrary.

## Where the truth lives

- **`firestore.rules` is the only enforcement that cannot be bypassed.** The
  browser talks to Firestore directly. Anything enforced in React — `can()`, a
  hidden button, a disabled field — is a usability feature. The same action
  succeeds from the browser console. If a change makes a permission decision,
  it belongs in the rules and needs a test in `tests/`.
- **`src/shared/modules/registry.js` is the module list.** It drives the
  sidebar, the dashboard grid and route mounting. Do not write the module count
  into a comment; it was wrong for a long time.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md` is the authority on open findings**, and
  `docs/PRODUCTION.md` on operating the deployed system. When another document
  restates either, it drifts. Link instead of copying.

## Three deployable units, two of them separate npm packages

`src/` (the SPA) and `functions/` each have their own `package.json`, lockfile
and test config. The root `npm test` only reaches `src/**`. CI runs both; a
local check that only runs the root script has tested half the repository.

There was a third package, `server/`, an Express + firebase-admin service meant
to take over the write path. It is **gone**. It served no traffic, nothing
deployed it, and its `src/authz/policy.js` was a hand-maintained second copy of
eight `firestore.rules` role helpers — a drift risk paid for every month against
a benefit with no date on it. If the write-path migration is revived, take it
out of the history rather than out of memory.

## The audit trail

One implementation: `logAudit` in `src/shared/org/orgData.js`. Modules wrap it to
supply their `module` key and a default `target`, and nothing else writes to
`auditLogs`.

This was five copy-pasted copies, and four of them omitted `module`. Admin →
Audit Log renders `MODULE_BY_KEY[l.module]`, so every entry those four wrote
displayed as "Core" and the log could not be filtered back to the module that
produced it. A trail that cannot attribute an action is not a trail.

## Personal data

Two files describe the same personal data for different purposes and live in
different npm packages, so no import can tie them together:

- `src/shared/crypto/policy.js` — which fields get sealed
- `functions/lib/subjectData.js` — where a person's records are, for subject access

A collection added to one and not the other is a silent gap: unsealed personal
data in the first case, a person's records missing from their own legal export in
the second. `EXPECTED_SEALED` in `subjectData.js` is checked by the test suite
for exactly this. Update both.

Before touching subject access, read `docs/DATA-RIGHTS.md` §2 — with encryption
on, a server-side scan for a name reads ciphertext, and **zero matches is
indistinguishable from a person who is genuinely not mentioned**.

## Seams

`src/shared/data/` and `src/shared/storage/` are adapter contracts. The header
comment in `src/shared/data/index.js` declares itself to be the specification —
it is, and an adapter that deviates is a bug in the adapter. Note that only two
files consume `dataProvider` while 39 import `firebase/firestore` directly; the
seam is real but not yet universal, so do not assume it.

`src/shared/module-kit/service.js` (`createModuleService`) is the org-scoped CRUD
factory. Prefer it over hand-rolling `collection(db, 'organizations', orgId, …)`.

## Testing

- Unit tests run in parallel and are stable there. They were not: the suite
  reported one to four phantom failures under `vitest run`, and the standing
  advice was `--no-file-parallelism`. The cause was `environment: 'jsdom'` set
  globally — 86 of 99 files are pure logic and needed no DOM, and building one
  per file per worker was both the flakiness and 90 seconds of a 160-second run.
  The default is now `node` and the DOM files opt in with a
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` docblock. **Put that docblock on any new test
  that touches the DOM**; without it the failure is immediate and obvious, which
  is the point.
- `npm run test:rules` and the Playwright suite need a **JDK** — the emulators
  are JVM processes. CI uses Java 17.
- Rules tests send hostile payloads, not well-behaved ones. A new rule needs a
  test that tries to defeat it, not one that confirms it works when used
  correctly.
- After changing `firestore.rules`, the result count must be **unchanged** unless
  you intended a semantic change. A refactor that moves the number changed
  meaning.

## Accessibility is enforced, in two places that do not overlap

`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` runs at **`error`** and is at zero. It is not advisory
and it is not a style rule: the sweep that got it to zero found the bulk-upload
drop zones were `<div onClick>` and therefore the only way to import a
spreadsheet was a mouse, and that a fishbone node could be selected, deleted and
gate-flipped from the keyboard but never renamed.

What lint cannot see, `e2e/accessibility.spec.js` does — axe against the rendered
DOM, failing on serious and critical. That division is deliberate:

- **Lint** sees the JSX: an icon-only button with no name, a `<label>` with no
  `htmlFor`, an element that answers a click and nothing else.
- **axe** sees the result: whether the label actually attached, whether the
  contrast is real. `<Field label="Date"><input /></Field>` is the app's dominant
  form control and `Field` binds the two at RUNTIME, which no static rule can
  check. Contrast is the same shape — it found the palette failing AA at its two
  most-used text stops while every line of markup was correct.

Three components take a **required** label and throw in development without one:
`Field`, `IconButton` and `ChartFrame`. That is on purpose. An optional
correctness step spread over hundreds of call sites is one most of them will
skip — which is exactly how ~50 unnamed icon buttons and 174 unattached labels
happened. Do not add a default to make the error go away; give it a name.

For colour, do not hand-pick a shade. `src/shared/lib/contrast.js` computes one:
`readableOnTint` for text on its own tinted chip, `solidBackground` for a fill
that has to carry white text.

## Two failure patterns worth recognising on sight

Both are documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` and both have bitten this codebase
three times each:

1. **The permissive union.** Firestore rules OR together. A narrow rule that
   refuses something is worthless while a broader `match` grants it. Adding a
   restrictive match block restricts nothing on its own.
2. **The post-state branch.** `request.resource.data` on an update is the state
   *after* the write. A rule that authorises against it lets the writer supply
   the value that authorises them.

## Style

- JavaScript, not TypeScript. No `tsconfig.json` anywhere, and that is
  deliberate — do not introduce one incidentally.
- Prettier: no semicolons, single quotes, width 100. `npm run format`.
- Comments explain *why*, and name the failure that motivated the code. The
  codebase carries no `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `console.log`; keep it that way.
- Line endings are mixed across the repo and `core.autocrlf` is on. Preserve
  whatever a file already uses rather than normalising it in an unrelated diff.
