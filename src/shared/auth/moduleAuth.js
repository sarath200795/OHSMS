// Module role adapters.
//
// Several modules were ported in from separate applications, each with its own
// role vocabulary — incidents thinks in reporter/investigator/admin, LOTO in
// admin/safety/engineering/technician, PTW in admin/engineering/operations/
// technician. Rather than rewrite every `can(role, …)` and role gate in those
// modules, each one keeps its own vocabulary and translates at the boundary.
//
// That translation was eight near-identical files. Three of them (fire, hira,
// inspections) were byte-for-byte identical and a fourth (committee) differed
// by one token; the rest differed only in the extra fields their ported code
// expects. This factory is the shared half. What stays per-module is the ROLE
// MAP — which is the part that is genuinely a decision — and any extra shape.
//
// Note what is NOT here: none of this is a permission control. The mapped role
// decides what the UI offers. What the user may actually do is decided by
// firestore.rules against their REAL platform role, which this never touches.
// A module that maps `manager` to its own `admin` is not granting anything.
