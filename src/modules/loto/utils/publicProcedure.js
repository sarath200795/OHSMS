/**
 * The public face of an isolation procedure.
 *
 * The QR printed on a procedure is stuck to a machine, and the person who scans
 * it is standing in front of that machine — often with no account and no reason
 * to have one. They need to know what to isolate, how, what will hurt them, how
 * to prove it is dead, and whether it is locked right now. They do not need to
 * know who locked it.
 *
 * That last point is why this file exists rather than a rule opening
 * /procedures/{id}: Firestore rules cannot restrict which FIELDS a read
 * returns, so publishing the procedure document would publish
 * lockState.techName, groupLock.members[].name, primaryTech and the approval
 * trail along with it. This mirrors the /qr and /permitQr pattern already used
 * for the equipment and permit codes.
 *
 * WHITELIST, never a blacklist. Every field published is named here explicitly,
 * so a field added to the procedure tomorrow stays private until someone
 * decides otherwise. A blacklist inverts that default, and the failure is
 * silent — the field is simply public one deploy later, with nothing to notice.
