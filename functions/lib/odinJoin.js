// This used to live only in the ODIN dashboard. The WhatsApp and Telegram
// lookups have to attribute an audit to a centre the same way, or a score
// the dashboard shows for DEMO001 is the score the phone says belongs to
// somebody else. functions/ cannot import the SPA, so the join lives here
// and the dashboard re-exports it.
//
// Nothing in this file may import node builtins or metabase.js. The
// dashboard bundle imports it, and metabase.js pulls in node:dns.

/**
 * Fill in what the warehouse did not say, from the site register this app
 * already holds.
 *
 * A Metabase question almost never carries coordinates, and asking an
 * organization to add latitude and longitude columns to their analytics
 * warehouse in order to see a map is asking them to duplicate a register they
 * are already maintaining here. So the join runs the other way: match on site
 * id first — an exact key beats a name every time — then on the site's name,
 * case- and space-insensitively.
 *
 * Region and entity are filled in the same way and only where the row is
 * SILENT. A row that states its own region wins: the warehouse is the system of
 * record for the finding, and quietly overwriting what it said with what our
 * register believes is how two dashboards start disagreeing.
 *
 * ── keepUnplaced, which is the scoping ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `sites` is the list the viewer may SEE, not the whole register — every
 * analytics tab is handed it that way. So a row matching none of them is either
 * a site outside this viewer's grant or a name our register does not carry, and
 * the two are indistinguishable from here.
 *
 * For someone who can see every site, it is the second: keep it, or a finding
 * whose warehouse spelling differs from ours vanishes from the totals. For
 * anyone else it is most likely the first, and showing them another region's
 * findings because the join happened to fail is the scoping mistake this whole
 * page is most exposed to. Same rule, same parameter name, as resolveIncidents.
