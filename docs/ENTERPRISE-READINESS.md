# Enterprise readiness

An honest assessment of what this app would meet, and what it would fail, in a
mid-to-large enterprise procurement or security review. Written against what is
in the repository today, not what is planned.

**Short answer: yes for the security review, with caveats on data lifecycle and
compliance paperwork.** The two items that used to stop a deal on their own —
no backups, and file storage that was not tenant-isolated — are both closed.

**Read this next to `SECURITY.md`, not instead of it.** That file is the
authority on what is open; this one is the buyer-facing summary. Where they
disagree, `SECURITY.md` is right.

## Scorecard

| Area | State | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant isolation (database) | Org-scoped paths, enforced in rules, 448 rules tests | **Ready** |
| Tenant isolation (files) | `orgId` claim on the token, enforced in `storage.rules` | **Ready** |
| Authentication | SAML/OIDC implemented and configured | **Ready** |
| MFA | TOTP, self-service enrolment, enabled | **Ready** |
| Authorization | 4 roles, site scoping, manager-only decisions — all in rules | **Ready** |
| Audit trail | Append-only, immutable, actor pinned to caller | **Ready** |
| Encryption at rest (application layer) | Envelope encryption, escrowed master key in Secret Manager, on | **Ready** |
| Abuse control on public surfaces | App Check enforced | **Ready** |
| Backups / disaster recovery | PITR (7d) + weekly schedule (30d), delete protection, **restore drilled** 2026-08-16 | **Ready** |
| Observability | Sentry wired with a DSN. Hosting uptime is a GitHub Action curling `/health.json` (`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`). No metrics, no on-call rotation | **Partial** |
| Data lifecycle — export | Subject access implemented (`exportSubjectData`) | **Ready** |
| Data lifecycle — erasure & retention | Recycle Bin purge covers incidents, illnesses **and injuries with their clinical documents**. Period table exists with `NEEDS_LEGAL_SIGN_OFF` (`functions/lib/retentionPolicy.js`). Live age-purge of statutory records is off. | **Partial** |
| Testing | 2466 unit, 584 rules, 448 functions, e2e smoke | **Ready** |
| CI/CD | Lint, tests (all four suites), build, audit gate; ordered deploy | **Ready** |
| Environments | Staging CI still cannot deploy functions (`iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` on the runtime SA — `DEPLOYMENT.md` §5). Production ships on `v*` tags through the `production` environment gate | **Partial** |
| Secrets handling | Nothing committed; client keys are appropriately public | **Ready** |
| Scalability | Read caps on every collection listener, with an incomplete-data notice on every screen that totals one (`SECURITY.md` S-04, closed) | **Ready** |
| Compliance artifacts | ISO 27001 self-audit written. DPA / subprocessor / pen-test **drafts** in `docs/compliance/` (not signed, not a certification) | **Partial** |

## What closed, and what it took

**File storage is tenant-isolated.** The blocker was that `storage.rules` could
only see what the ID token claimed, and the token carried no `orgId`. Only the
Admin SDK can set a custom claim, and there was no `functions/` tier to do it.
`syncUserClaims` and `backfillClaims` are live in `asia-south1`, the claim is on
the token, and the stricter ruleset is deployed. `SECURITY.md` S-01.

**Manager-only actions are enforced in rules.** Approving permits, deciding
defect reports and managing sites were gated in React only, so an ordinary
member could do them from the SDK. For a safety system that mattered more than
it sounds: the value of an approval is that only the approver could have made
it. `SECURITY.md` S-02.

**Backups exist and a restore has actually been performed.** PITR with a 7-day
window, a weekly scheduled export at 30-day retention, and delete protection —
plus a drill on 2026-08-16 that restored a real backup into a scratch database
in about 15 minutes. That distinction is the whole point: a backup nobody has
restored is a belief, not a control. `PRODUCTION.md` §3 and §3a, and §3a is
worth reading *before* you need it, because a restore in progress looks exactly
like an empty backup for most of its run.

**Console hardening is applied.** App Check on the public write surfaces, TOTP
for admins, application-layer encryption on, API key referrer restrictions.
`SECURITY.md` S-05, now closed.

## The remaining gaps

**Retention periods still need a lawyer, not another engineer.** Subject access
works. Erasure is classified but not executed, deliberately. Recycle Bin purge
already destroys manager-deleted incidents, illnesses, injuries and equipment
after 30 days. What a privacy review will still ask is **how long a live
statutory record is kept**: that table now exists
(`functions/lib/retentionPolicy.js`) with every personal-data row marked
`NEEDS_LEGAL_SIGN_OFF`, and live age-purge is off until those questions are
signed. See `DATA-RIGHTS.md` §3. A buyer's privacy review will ask.

**One trap worth naming, because encryption is now on.** Every field the
subject-access "mentions" scan would search is a field the crypto policy seals.
A server-side scan for a name therefore reads ciphertext and finds nothing — and
**zero matches is indistinguishable from a person who is genuinely not
mentioned**. That is a silent wrong answer to a legal request.
`scanFeasibility()` exists to say so out loud; the mentions half must be done in
the browser of somebody entitled to the keys, or recorded as not performed. It
must never be reported as "none found". `DATA-RIGHTS.md` §2.

**Nothing is watching in real time** used to be true. Sentry still has a DSN
for errors-while-up. Hosting uptime is now a scheduled GitHub Action against
`/health.json` (`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`). A down site emails whoever has
Actions failure notifications on this repository. Metrics and an on-call
rotation are still absent.

**Console state is invisible to version control.** App Check, MFA, the API key
restrictions, backups — all of them are toggles in a console, and nothing in
this repository fails if one is switched off later. Re-verifying them is
`docs/CONSOLE-HARDENING.md`, on a calendar, not in a code review.

**Compliance artifacts are drafts.** `ISO27001-AUDIT.md` is a substantial
internal self-audit (private). `docs/compliance/` now has a DPA stub, a
subprocessor list derived from what the app uses, and a pen-test scope
outline — all marked DRAFT / not legal advice. They are not a certification.

**Scalability has a known ceiling.** Whole collections are read with no limit
(`SECURITY.md` S-04) and aggregation happens in the browser. The analytics page
opens eleven such listeners at once. Fine now; a tenant with tens of thousands
of records will find the edge.

## What is genuinely strong

Worth saying plainly, because gap lists read worse than the system is:

- **Tenancy is enforced where it cannot be bypassed.** Not in middleware someone
  can forget to call — in rules, with 455 tests that send hostile payloads
  rather than well-behaved ones.
- **The audit trail is real.** Append-only, no updates, no deletes, entries
  pinned to the caller.
- **The public QR surfaces are tightly bound.** An anonymous write must present
  a token that resolves to the org and the asset being written to, so a write is
  tied to physical access to the equipment. Sharper than most products manage on
  an unauthenticated endpoint.
- **The seams are real.** Storage and data sit behind adapters with a documented
  contract, so swapping infrastructure is a file, not a project.
- **The deploy order is understood and written down**, including the failure
  modes that motivated it — rules before hosting, backfill before rules.
- **The security register is kept honestly.** Findings are written up with what
  the attacker actually gets, including the ones that are still open.

## Suggested order

1. Retention periods signed off by someone with legal authority
   (`docs/DATA-RIGHTS.md` §3, `functions/lib/retentionPolicy.js`) — the largest
   remaining gap, and the one a privacy review will find first
2. Confirm the uptime Action is watched (`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`) and that
   Sentry notifications actually reach someone
3. Counsel-complete the DPA / subprocessor drafts in `docs/compliance/`
4. A penetration test against `docs/compliance/PENTEST-SCOPE.md`, once 1–3
   are done
5. Walk `docs/CONSOLE-HARDENING.md` on a calendar (S-05)

## Decisions taken, so they are not re-litigated

Written down because each of these looks like an oversight from the outside, and
each one is a choice.

### Accessibility — WCAG 2.1 AA, enforced two ways

A buyer asking for a VPAT or an accessibility statement can be pointed at
something real rather than an intention:

- **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` at `error`, not `warn`.** Every rule in the
  recommended set, plus `control-has-associated-label`, is enforced and at zero.
  The gate was built as a ratchet — each rule sat at `warn` while its backlog was
  cleared and moved to `error` in the change that cleared it — and the ratchet is
  now fully wound. It cannot regress without failing CI.
- **`@axe-core/playwright` against the rendered DOM** (`e2e/accessibility.spec.js`),
  failing on any serious or critical WCAG 2.1 A/AA violation, over the portal, a
  list page, a form and an open dialog.

Both halves are load-bearing and neither is redundant. The dominant form control
in this app binds its label to its input at runtime, which is invisible to a
static rule and plain to axe; an icon-only button with no name is the reverse.
Static lint for what is statically visible, axe for the rest.

What this found that no review had: the colour palette failed AA at its two
most-used text stops (`SECURITY.md` S-23). The markup was right and the colours
were wrong, which is precisely the class of defect a code review cannot see.

### Offline — not supported, deliberately

Firestore's `persistentLocalCache` is enabled, so data survives a connection
drop and the app keeps working while it is open. There is **no service worker
and no web app manifest**: the app is not installable, and a hard refresh with no
signal is a blank page.

That is a known limit, not an omission. It was assessed and declined: the users
are online in practice, and a service worker brings a cache-invalidation surface
that has to be right on every deploy — a real cost against a benefit nobody has
asked for.

If a customer does require offline capture — field inspections in a plant room
with no signal is the plausible case — treat it as a project, not a patch. The
data path is the easy half; the hard half is conflict resolution on a permit or
an isolation procedure that two people edited while apart, and that is a safety
decision before it is a technical one.

### Malware scanning — magic bytes are not a scanner (S-25)

Decision record: `docs/ADR-0001-malware-scanning.md`. Sniff ≠ malware scan;
sealed ciphertext cannot be scanned as plaintext; the two owner choices are
an in-project scanner on unsealed prefixes, or a written exclusion of sealed
medical documents (plus a subprocessor if a vendor is later chosen).

`src/shared/storage/sniffType.js` refuses an executable header and a declared
type the bytes contradict. That is honesty about type, not detection of malice.
A genuine PDF carrying a payload passes, and a test asserts that so the check
cannot be mistaken for more than it is. `docs/SECURITY.md` S-25 is the closed
write-up.

Until an owner chooses one of the two options in the ADR, this stays accepted.
Do not add a pretend scanner in front of ciphertext.
