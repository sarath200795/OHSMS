// Activity-specific precautions for the weather-risk digest.
//
// The High-risk table used to print one paragraph per hazard, the same for a
// gym and a construction yard. The wording now follows the work the
// organisation has actually recorded, and the work recorded at the site when
// that is more specific. Nothing recorded still prints the general paragraph
// (GENERIC_PRECAUTIONS). The mail layout and the admin recipient list are
// untouched.
//
// Where the activities come from
//
// 1. organisations/{orgId}.activityTypes — Org settings → Activities
//    performed. This is the only org-wide activity list. There is no separate
//    industry field. The built-in choices live in src/shared/org/orgConstants.js
//    (ACTIVITY_TYPES); admins can add their own labels.
// 2. organisations/{orgId}.weatherPrecautions — the same screen. An override
//    of the built-in sentence for one activity and one alert. Blank means the
//    built-in sentence.
// 3. The site document. There is no site-type enum (fitness centre, warehouse,
//    office, kitchen are not a stored list). A custom attribute whose key is a
//    type, category, facility or activity field is read as one, and so is an
//    attribute value that is exactly a catalog label. site.activityTypes is
//    honoured when a site document carries it; the site form does not edit it.
// 4. HIRA, organisations/{orgId}/assessments. Site-scoped rows (siteId,
//    siteName; baselines are skipped). Activity titles, hazard types and hazard
//    categories are matched. Free text that does not match the catalog is
//    ignored, so "inspect the site office" does not turn a yard into an office.
// 5. Permits, organisations/{orgId}/permits. typeOfWork and the hazard
//    multi-select. Matched on siteId when the permit has one, otherwise on the
//    site name (`site`). Job descriptions and the name the permit was issued
//    to are not read: one is not an activity, the other is personal data.
//
// A site profile (what the place is) replaces the organisation profile for
// that site. A task (hot work, height, electrical, a delivery) is added on
// top, because the yard is still a construction site when today's permit is
// hot work. The cell keeps at most three tasks and one profile so a long
// register cannot turn the row into a second mail.
//
// This module is pure on purpose. The SPA settings screen imports it, and the
// functions package cannot import the SPA. Firestore reads stay in
// loadPrecautionFor, which the digest calls. UV is not an alert here. Heat
// High remains an air temperature strictly above 40°C, decided in
// weatherBands.js, not in this file.
