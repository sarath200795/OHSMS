 * STATUTORY is kept forever, which is itself a data-protection finding:
 * indefinite retention is not lawful merely because some retention is.
 *
 * This file is the period table that was missing. Every row that is not the
 * Recycle Bin's already-enforced 30-day purge is marked NEEDS_LEGAL_SIGN_OFF.
 * Nothing here starts deleting live statutory or medical records. The nightly
 * sweep (`purgeSoftDeleted`) still only destroys documents a manager has
 * already put in the Recycle Bin, after thirty days.
 *
 * Pure. No Firestore. `retention.js` is the destructive planner; this is the
 * policy it must not outrun.
