// Where a document applies: organization, region or site.
//
// The level is the answer to "is this mine?". A site manager opening the library
// needs the org-wide policies, the ones written for their region, and the ones
// written for their site — and needs the other forty sites' paperwork out of the
// way. That only works if the level is a fixed set of three, not a free-text tag
// that becomes "Site", "site-level" and "Kochi only" within a month.
//
// Two of the three levels name something, and the name is the whole point:
// "Region" without a region says a document is narrower than the organization
// without saying where, which nobody can act on. So a level that fails to name
// what it exists to name is treated as no classification at all — it lands with
// the documents that predate the field, because both need the same fix.
//
// ── Who writes this now ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nobody picks a level any more. The FOLDER a document is filed in decides it:
// tree.js turns a placement into a call to classificationFields below, so the
// browser and the security rule are written from the same act. What used to be
// a Level dropdown beside a Region dropdown — two controls that could disagree
// with each other and with where the document appeared — is now one.
//
// That is why this file no longer renders anything. It has one job: produce the
// fields firestore.rules reads. Levels and their storage still follow Objectives
// (level + the thing it scopes to) and the site fields every other module writes.
