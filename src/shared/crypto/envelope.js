// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The wire format of an encrypted value, and the four operations on it.
//
// This file knows about AES-GCM and about a string layout. It knows nothing
// about organizations, roles, callables or which fields are sensitive — those
// decisions live in policy.js and keyring.js, and keeping them out of here is
// what makes every guarantee below testable against a raw key with no Firebase
// anywhere near it.
//
// ── The format ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//     enc:1:<keyId>:<iv>:<ciphertext>
//
// A STRING, deliberately, rather than a map of {iv, ct} — because it has to
// drop into fields that already exist and are already typed. `medication` is a
// string today and stays a string; `narrative` likewise. A map would change the
// shape of every document, break every `.trim()` and `.toLowerCase()` in the
// renderers, and turn a confidentiality change into a schema migration for
// forty screens. It also survives every transport this app already uses without
// special-casing: JSON, a Firestore write, a CSV export, a PDF cell.
//
// Both binary segments are base64URL with no padding. Not standard base64: `+`
// and `/` are fine inside a Firestore string but are not fine in the other
// places these values reach — a URL query, a filename, a CSV cell that a
// spreadsheet decides to interpret — and `=` padding is the character most
// likely to be stripped by something well-meaning in between. The alphabet is
// therefore [A-Za-z0-9_-], which is the same alphabet storagePath()'s seg()
// already guarantees it will not rewrite.
//
// ── Why the plaintext is JSON ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `bodyParts` is an array, `daysToReturnToWork` is a number-or-empty-string,
// `firstAidDone` is a boolean. Encrypting only strings would leave the array
// and the number in the clear, and encrypting their `String(v)` would hand back
// "3" where a 3 was stored and "a,b" where ['a','b'] was — silently, on read,
// forever after. JSON.stringify/parse round-trips every value this app stores
// in an encrypted field and restores the ORIGINAL type, so a caller cannot tell
// from the value it gets back that the field was ever encrypted.
//
// The one thing it does not round-trip is `undefined`, which JSON has no
// representation for. sealValue returns it unchanged rather than storing "null":
// an absent field and a field holding null are different answers to a clinical
// question, and Firestore already refuses undefined outright.
//
// ── Why there is additional authenticated data ───────────────────────────────
//
// AES-GCM authenticates its ciphertext, so nobody can alter a value without the
// tag failing. What a tag alone does NOT stop is MOVING an intact ciphertext:
// one key encrypts every field in an organization, so a ciphertext lifted out of
// `injuries/…/medication` and pasted into a field the app renders to everyone
// would decrypt perfectly and print the medication on a public screen. Anyone
// with write access to any encrypted field could read every encrypted field
// that way, which would make the whole exercise decorative.
//
// So every value is bound, at encryption time, to `orgId` and to the field path
// it belongs to. Move it anywhere else and decryption fails closed.
//
// What the binding deliberately does NOT include is the collection or the
// document id, and that is not an oversight. Documents in this app move:
// confineMedicalRecords lifts a record pointer out of incidents/{id}/photos and
// writes it into injuries/{id}/records, and seedInjuryRecords copies clinical
// fields from one document into another. A binding that named the collection
// would turn every one of those migrations into a decryption failure — data
// loss dressed up as a security control. The field path is the finest binding
// that survives the moves this codebase actually performs.
//
// ── The IV, and the bound that governs key rotation ──────────────────────────
//
// 96 random bits per value, from the platform CSPRNG, never a counter. With a
// random IV, AES-GCM's safety margin is a birthday bound: collision probability
// stays negligible below roughly 2^32 encryptions under one key. That is the
// real reason keyId is in the format — not because a key is expected to leak,
// but because one eventually has to be retired, and a format with no key
// identifier can only ever be rotated by rewriting every document at once.
// Old ciphertext keeps naming the key that sealed it and stays readable.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ── The second scheme, and why one is not enough ─────────────────────────────
//
// Everything above assumes the reader and the writer are the same population.
// For incidents, meetings and drills they are. For health records they are
// explicitly NOT, and firestore.rules says so out loud: /injuries, its /records
// subcollection and /illnesses are `allow read: if isManagerOf(orgId)`, while
// the WRITE comes through the generic rule as isWriterOf — so an ordinary
// member fills in Step 1a of the incident wizard, files a colleague's medication
// and days off, and cannot read any of it back. That asymmetry is the control.
//
// A symmetric key cannot express it. Handing the member a key so they can
// encrypt hands them the key that decrypts, and every member could then read
// every colleague's clinical record — the exact exposure the rules were changed
// to close, reintroduced by the thing meant to reinforce them. Encryption that
// has to be given to everyone who writes protects the data from nobody who
// matters.
//
// So health fields use a hybrid:
//
//     enk:1:<keyId>:<wrappedCek>:<iv>:<ciphertext>
//
//   · a fresh 256-bit content key (CEK) per value, used once for AES-GCM;
//   · that CEK wrapped with the organization's RSA-OAEP PUBLIC key, which any
//     writer may hold because a public key cannot decrypt anything;
//   · the private half released only to admin and manager, on the same test
//     isManagerOf already applies.
//
// The writer discards the CEK the moment the value is sealed and keeps no way
// back to it. Write-without-read stops being a rule that a rules bug can undo
// and becomes arithmetic.
//
// Per VALUE rather than per document, which costs ~340 characters of wrapped key
// on each sealed field. The cheaper design — one CEK per document, wrapped once
// — cannot survive a partial update: `updateDoc(ref, { medication })` would have
// to reuse the document's existing CEK, and the member issuing that update
// cannot unwrap it, so they would have to mint a new one and every field they
// did NOT write would become permanently unreadable. Six fields on an injury
// record is about two kilobytes against Firestore's one-megabyte limit. Silent
// data loss on a partial write is not a trade worth two kilobytes.
