// What a file ACTUALLY is, from its first bytes — not from what the upload
// claims it is.
//
// ── The gap this closes (audit finding M-6, A.8.7) ──────────────────────────
//
// `storage.rules` allow-lists content types, and that allow-list is genuinely
// load-bearing: it is what stops an object being SERVED as text/html from a
// Google-owned domain, which would make the tenant's evidence store a phishing
// host. But it constrains `request.resource.contentType`, and that value is
// supplied by the client. A browser sets it from the file extension; anything
// that is not this app sets it to whatever it likes.
//
// So the rule answers "may an object be served as this type", and nothing
// answered "is this file what it says it is". Members upload documents into a
// shared store and colleagues download them, which makes the app a distribution
// path between employees — the thing A.8.7 is actually about. Nothing scanned
// any of it.
//
// ── Why this is a sniffer and not a virus scanner ───────────────────────────
//
// A real scanner needs infrastructure this project does not have (ClamAV on
// Cloud Run) or a third-party API — and sending occupational health records,
// GP letters and fit notes to a scanning vendor is a worse privacy outcome than
// not scanning, and would make that vendor a subprocessor of medical data.
// Worse, it cannot work at all where it matters most: files in the sealed
// collections are AES-GCM ciphertext at rest, so there is nothing for any
// scanner to read. See docs/SECURITY.md S-25.
//
// What is proportionate, needs no infrastructure, and is testable is this:
// refuse the upload when the bytes disagree with the declared type, and refuse
// executables outright. That closes the case where a file is not what the
// person downloading it will believe it is, which is the precondition for
// almost every way this becomes somebody's problem.
//
// It is NOT a claim that a conforming file is safe. A genuine PDF can carry a
// malicious payload and this will pass it. The control is honesty about type,
// not detection of malice, and SECURITY.md says so rather than letting the
// existence of a check imply more than it does.
