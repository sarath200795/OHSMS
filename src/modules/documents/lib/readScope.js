// shorter. So once site-level documents are restricted, the library can no
// longer ask for everything and let the server sort it out: the query has to
// describe exactly the set the rule permits, or a member sees nothing at all.
//
// That failure would be silent, too. The module service swallows a read error
// into an empty list, so getting this wrong renders an empty library rather
// than an error anyone would report. Hence this file, and hence it being pure:
// the plan is worth testing on its own.
//
// The plan mirrors firestore.rules exactly:
//   elevated (admin | manager | auditor) → everything, one unfiltered query
//   everyone else → visibility == 'all', PLUS siteId in <sites they can reach>
