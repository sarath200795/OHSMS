/**
 * Block a merge on high or critical advisories in what actually ships — with a
 * named allowlist rather than a lowered bar.
 *
 * `npm audit --audit-level=critical` was the first version, because one
 * unfixable high (xlsx) would otherwise have made the gate red on the day it
 * shipped, and a gate that is always red is a gate nobody reads. But lowering
 * the threshold hides every OTHER high too, which is most of what a dependency
 * gate exists to catch.
 *
 * So: fail on high and above, and allow exactly the advisories named below,
 * each with a reason and a condition for removing it. Anything not on the list
 * fails. The list is short on purpose — if it grows, that is the signal, not
 * the workaround.
 *
 * ── Which tree ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   node scripts/audit-gate.mjs                  # the app's runtime tree
 *   node scripts/audit-gate.mjs functions        # the Cloud Functions tree
 *
 * and the same two including devDependencies, which report everything and never
 * block — a critical in the toolchain is not a fact about the shipped product:
 *
 *   node scripts/audit-gate.mjs root-all
 *   node scripts/audit-gate.mjs functions-all
 *
 * The functions tree used to be gated by a bare
 * `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` in the workflow. Running both trees
 * through one script is not tidying: that bare command reads its verdict from
 * npm's EXIT CODE, which is 1 both when the tree has a high advisory and when
 * npm could not reach the advisory service at all. Those are opposite facts —
 * "the product ships a known vulnerability" and "we learned nothing today" —
 * and CI reported them identically, as a red required check with a stack of
 * registry noise above it.
