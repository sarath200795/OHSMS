//
// A site page showing "24°C, light rain" tells a safety officer nothing they
// could act on. What matters is whether today's conditions put a control at
// risk: heat stress, cold stress, rain, lightning and air quality. So this
// maps raw observations onto the same five-band scale the rest of the app
// uses for risk, and names the work that each band affects.
//
// Wind, visibility, UV, freezing rain and snow are not hazards here. A field
// for one of them on an observation does not produce a row.
//
// The cuts match functions/lib/weatherBands.js. The functions package cannot
// import the SPA, so a cut-off has to move in both files.
//
// Pure — no network, no clock. `assessWeather` takes an already-normalised
// observation so the thresholds can be tested directly.
