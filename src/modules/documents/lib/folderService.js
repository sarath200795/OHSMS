// Only SUBFOLDERS are stored. The roots — Org Level Documents and one per
// region — are derived from the site registry on every render (see tree.js), so
// there is nothing here to keep in step with it.
//
// No entry in firestore.rules. `documentFolders` is a new collection name, so
// the generic /organizations/{orgId}/{col}/{docId} rule already covers it, and
// covers it correctly: any approved member reads, a writer creates and renames,
// and only a MANAGER may delete. That last one is not an accident of the
// generic rule — deleting a folder is the destructive operation here, and it is
// the same bar the rules put on deleting any other record.
//
// A folder record is metadata and nothing else: a name, the root it hangs off,
// and its parent. The documents inside it point AT it; it does not list them.
// That is what makes renaming a folder free and moving one cheap.
